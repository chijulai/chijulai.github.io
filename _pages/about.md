Hi, I’m Frank Lai — a data scientist with over four years of experience turning complex real-world challenge into actionable data-driven solutions. Past experience in data science includes my work as a [Data Scientist Intern](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7241443042220457984/) at [Medidata Solutions](https://www.medidata.com/en/clinical-trial-products/medidata-ai/real-world-data/clinical-trial-design-software/), supervised by [Afrah Shafquat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/afrahshafquat/), a Data Scientist at [University of Rochester Medical Center](https://son.rochester.edu/directory/dillondzikowicz/), supervised by [Dillon Dzikowicz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dillon-dzikowi/), and a Data Science Researcher at Intelligent Information System and Data Analytics Laboratory, supervised by [Ping-Feng Pai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=heXAiYMAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=2) and [Jing-Rung Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2OAd9VoAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=2).

I specialize in Machine Learning, Generative AI, NLP, and LLM, with a strong background in EHR data integration and clinical trial RWD analytics. I’ve built large-scale databases across multi-hospital networks, developed ML pipelines to generate synthetic clinical trial data, and applied AI methods to improve cardiovascular risk stratification and early disease detection. My work has been presented at major scientific conferences and has supported both academic research and industry innovation. Beyond the technical side, I enjoy collaborating across disciplines — from clinicians and researchers to engineers and business teams — to design solutions that are not only scientifically rigorous but also practically impactful.

I’m passionate about applying data science to solve real-world problems and eager to contribute to projects at the intersection of AI, healthcare, and digital transformation.
