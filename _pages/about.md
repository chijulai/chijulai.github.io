**Bio** I’m a data scientist with over four years of experience turning complex real-world challenge into actionable data-driven solutions. Past experience in data science includes my work as a [Data Scientist Intern](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7241443042220457984/) at [Medidata Solutions](https://www.medidata.com/en/clinical-trial-products/medidata-ai/real-world-data/clinical-trial-design-software/), a Data Scientist at [University of Rochester Medical Center](https://son.rochester.edu/directory/dillondzikowicz/), and a Data Science Researcher at Intelligent Information System and Data Analytics Laboratory.

I specialize in Machine Learning, Generative AI, NLP, and LLMs, with a strong background in large-scale data management and predictive modeling using Python, R, SQL, and Tableau. I’ve built multi-hospital databases with over 10 million patient records, developed ML pipelines to generate high-fidelity synthetic clinical trial data, and applied AI methods to improve clinical decision-making. My work has been presented at major scientific conferences and has supported both academic research and industry innovation.

Beyond the technical side, I enjoy collaborating across disciplines — from clinicians and researchers to engineers and business teams — to design solutions that are not only scientifically rigorous but also practically impactful.

Outside of work, I enjoy working out, playing badminton, reading, and singing.
